                    <p class="auto">
                        In the midst of uncertainty, I embarked on a path in computer science, unsure of what lay ahead. 
                        The workload seemed daunting, and doubts crept in, making me question my abilities. 
                        Comparing myself to peers only added to my uncertainty.
                        However, I found strength in my support system - friends and family who stood by me during the toughest times. 
                        With their encouragement, and the guidance of fellow computer science students, I learned to believe in myself.
                        Today, I stand with newfound confidence, understanding that doubt is temporary. 
                        I'm ready to embrace challenges with courage and resilience. I know I belong in this field, and with belief in myself and support from others, I'm prepared for whatever comes my way.
